   ### I learn a lot of things to this assignment so i want to share few points.

   ##### In this assignment I learnt Arrow function which is most important concept in JavaScript and arrow functions make our code more concise, and simplify function.

   ### Arraow function

   ##### An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to the this, arguments, super, or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.

   For Example:

   () => { statements }

   #### As we remember "this", arrow functions do not have this. If this is accessed, it is taken from the outside.

   #### Arrow functions also donâ€™t bind an arguments object. With function expressions.
