//                <p>Happay was founded in 2012 with a simple idea: paying someone, 
//                    be it friends, family or colleagues should be as easy as sending a text message. 
//                    With this in mind, we built our first consumer product, 
//                    the happay mobile app- a mobile wallet that allows you to pay just about anyone, anywhere,
//                    with their mobile number. No bank account details required.
//                 </p>
//            </div>
//        );
//    }
